## A. Customer Journey

### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

### Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_id, p.plan_name, s.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.plans AS p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN ('1', '2', '11', '13', '15', '16', '18', '19')
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.plan_id;
```
