### Join All The Things

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
CASE WHEN s.order_date >= mem.join_date THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END AS member
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members AS mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name;
```

### Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the `ranking` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null `ranking` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

```sql
WITH Temp AS (
  SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
  CASE WHEN s.order_date >= mem.join_date THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END AS member
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members AS mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
  ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name
)

SELECT *,
CASE WHEN member = 'Y' THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date)
ELSE null END AS ranking
FROM Temp;
```
